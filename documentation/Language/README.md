# Android Programming Languages
All Android applications written in Java, Kotlin, and/or C/C++. As of 7 May 2019, **Google announced that the Kotlin programming language for Android app developers**.

## Java

When Google revealed the [first version of their Android OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_avwGFsv60U), they adopted Java as the main language for Android application development

But why Java? As one of the oldest object-oriented languages, Java is easy to learn and it works well on the Dalvik virtual machine, which was inspired by Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it portable for almost any device and operating system. So, when Google began building the Android system, Java was one of the most suitable languages.

Java's advantages:
* Object-Oriented
* Simple
* Platform-Independent
* Java is Secure

Java's disadvantages:
* Java is slow compared than C/C++

## Kotlin

Kotlin was born from JetBrains. It was initially designed for the JVM environment and combines 
functional and object-oriented programming. Since its release, Kotlin has become a rising star in 
Android development and other fields.

Here are a few reasons why Kotlin pairs so well with Android:

* **Interoperability**: Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java and supports great interoperability with 
JVM environments. 
* **Safety**: Android apps that contain Kotlin code are 20% less likely to crash according 
to [the Android docs](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first). 
* **Asynchronicity**: Kotlinâ€™s use of [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) allows it to provide asynchronous 
(non-blocking) programming support.

In addition to the points above, Google announced their [Kotlin-first approach to Android development 
at Google I/O 2019](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first). Since the announcement, the number 
of applications built with Kotlin has increased exponentially.

Google said ***"Write better Android apps faster with Kotlin. Kotlin is a modern statically typed 
programming language used by over 60% of professional Android developers that helps boost productivity, 
developer satisfaction, and code safety."*** on their [Kotlin for Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/kotlin).
