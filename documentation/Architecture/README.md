# Android Architecture Patterns
When developers work on a real mobile application whose nature is dynamic and will expand its
features according to the user's need, then it is not possible to write core logic in activities
or fragments. To structure the project's code and to give it a modular design(separated code parts),
architecture patterns are applied to separate the concerns.

In this learning path I'll cover those patterns:
* [MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)](MVVM)
* MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
* MVI (Model-View-Intent)
* MVC (Model-View-Controller)
* Clean Architecture

The main idea of all these patterns is to organize the project in a proper way so that all the codes
get covered in the Unit Testing. Moreover, it is very helpful in the maintenance of the software,
to add and remove features and developers can keep a track of various crucial logic parts.
