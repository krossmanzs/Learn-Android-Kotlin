# App Components
### Project: [appcomponent](../../appcomponent)
App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry 
point through which the system or a user can enter your app. Some components depend on others.

There are four different types of app components:

* **[Activities](Activities)**: They dictate the UI and handle the user interaction to the smart phone screen.
* **[Services](Services)**: They handle background processing associated with an application.
* **[Broadcast]()** receivers: They handle communication between Android OS and applications.
* **[Content providers]()**: They handle data and database management issues.

Each type serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how the component is 
created and destroyed. The following sections describe the four types of app components.
