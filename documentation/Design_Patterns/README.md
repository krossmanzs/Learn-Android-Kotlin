# Design Patterns
Design Pattern usually deal with objects. They present a solution to a reoccurring problem that an
object shows and help eradicate design-specific problems. In other words, they represent challenges,
other developers already faced and prevent you from reinventing the wheel by showing you proven
ways to solve those problems.

## Benefits
1. Design Patterns use object-oriented concepts such as decomposition, inheritance, and polymorphism.
2. They can improve the re-usability and extensibility of Android apps. It means you do not need to
    write the same code again at various places, and also you can able to add other features to your
    app much more easier than general coding. Therefore, Design Patterns can increase speed in application
    development in Android.
3. They can make your codes cleaner by decoupling the code. In addition, Design Patterns can enhance 
    the understanding of codes in Android apps.
4. Design Patterns are proved and testified solutions because they have been build upon the knowledge
    and experience of expert application developers.
5. They make communication between developers more efficiently. _[source](https://medium.com/kayvan-kaseb/builder-design-pattern-in-android-a38dccb75485)_

There are so many pattern:
### Creational Patterns
* Builder
* Dependency Injection
* Singleton
* Factory

### Structural Patterns
* Adapter
* Facade
* Decorator
* Composite

### Behavioral Patterns
* Command
* Observer
* Strategy
* State

## On this project, I only learn those patterns:
* [Builder Pattern](Builder_Pattern)
* [Factory Pattern](Factory_Pattern)
* [Dependency Injection](../Dependency_Injection)
* [Observer Pattern](Observer_Pattern)
* [Repository Pattern](Repository_Pattern)
