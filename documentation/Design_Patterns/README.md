# Design Patterns
Design Pattern usually deal with objects. They present a solution to a reoccurring problem that an
object shows and help eradicate design-specific problems. In other words, they represent challenges,
other developers already faced and prevent you from reinventing the wheel by showing you proven
ways to solve those problems.

There are so many pattern:
### Creational Patterns
* Builder
* Dependency Injection
* Singleton
* Factory

### Structural Patterns
* Adapter
* Facade
* Decorator
* Composite

### Behavioral Patterns
* Command
* Observer
* Strategy
* State

## On this project, I only learn those patterns:
* Builder Pattern
* Factory Pattern
* Dependency Injection
* Observer Pattern
* Repository Pattern
